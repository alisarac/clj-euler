# euler

Just for practice.
Solutions to [Project Euler problems](https://projecteuler.net/problems) in clojure programming language. I am trying to solve every week at least one problem, or do some refactoring already solved ones.

## Usage

Solutions are mostly clojure functions, and I am sure they are not best solutions. Currently using repl to execute functions. There is no any interface.
